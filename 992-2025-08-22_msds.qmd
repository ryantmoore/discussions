Data Science

***

\Huge
Particular intersection of 

- Statistical practice
- Computational tools
- Substantive knowledge


***

\LARGE

>- Stats: prediction (vs. explanation), algorithms (vs. models)
>- Computing: addressing problems with data _per se_ (size, tidy-ness, un/structure, replicability)
>- Substance: social science

# Three Tasks of Data Science

\Large 

Description

>- Identifying patterns, etc.
>- E.g., $k$-means clustering to discover groups

# Three Tasks of Data Science

\Large 

Prediction

>- Components
>    - Inputs/outputs  
(predictors/outcomes, features/responses, \ldots)
>    - Mapping from inputs to outputs  
(linear model, decision tree, \ldots)
>    - Metric for evaluating mapping
>- With these, model/machine learning algorithm does the work
>- E.g., regression, random forests, neural networks, \ldots

# Three Tasks of Data Science

\large

Causal Inference

>- Potential outcomes/counterfactual/interventionist perspective
>- Requires _expertise_ different to description/prediction
>- Requires more than summary statistics, metrics, etc.
>- Requires some knowledge of causal structure
>    - Not all inputs treated same
>    - $T$ v. $\mathbf X$ v. $M$ -- very different!
>    - (the more knowledge, the better!)
>- E.g., experiments, observational causal designs, \ldots

# Goals

\Large

- Computational tools (R, Python, etc.)
- Varied data experience, original work
- Apply knowledge in academia, government, industry
- Communicate understanding

# Requirements

\Large

>- 10 courses / 30 credits
>- Choose a track: **Applied Public Affairs**, Business Analytics, Computer Sci, Cybersecurity, 
Environmental Sci, Finance, Int'l Economic Relations, Investigative Journalism, Microeconomic Analysis, Specialized Methods
>- Catalog ('25-'26): https://t.ly/Ib43y
