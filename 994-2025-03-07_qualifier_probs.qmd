# Content Problems

## Content Problems

>- Overclaiming  
~~"I prove democracy is not real"~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ \newline "I provide evidence consist with failure of representation"
>- Underclaiming: under-contextualizing, conceptually  
~~Describe one result~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ \newline Your question is a case of a more general political phenomenon. Explain what your answer teaches us about that phenomenon.
>- Claiming causality without causal identification  
~~"The effect of X"~~, ~~"X increases Y"~~
>- Book-reporting  
~~Literature review~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ 
>    - Teach us enough to understand the frontier of knowledge
>    - Explain how you move that frontier
>    - Every paper must be related to the paper you are writing
>- Organization  
~~"(Why is this here?)"~~ ~~"(How related to prior?)"~~

## Content Problems

>- Unclear connection betwn theoretical model, hypotheses  
~~Vague description of A, description of B, my Hyp1~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ "Under A, we should see X; under B, we should see Y. I argue for model C, which implies that we should see Z."
>- Abrupt hypotheses  
~~"And now, after that lit review, here's H1"~~
>- Insufficient statistical interpretation  
~~"The coef is 0.2"~~ $\rightsquigarrow$
>    - "Pred prob turnout for median is 0.45; for Q3 is 0.53"
>    - Take time to make graphics
>    - Uncertainty, inference
>- Insufficient detail about the case, data, methods, etc.  
~~History of India~~, ~~Assume we know India~~

## Content Problems

>- Ignoring counterarguments, alternative explanations  
~~"I've shown you evidence consistent with my theory X"~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ "I've shown you evidence consistent with my theory X, but also inconsistent with Y and Z." Have _something_ to say; demonstrate that you've thought about the problem.


# Design Problems

## Design Problems

>- Failing to recognize design's weaknesses  
~~"Because coefficient is positive, X causes Y"~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ \newline design that enables answering Q you propose
>- Failing to recognize data's limits  
~~Cool data that can't answer question~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ \newline Data + Method that address exactly what you propose
>- Accepting unacceptable limits  
~~"X is too hard"~~, ~~"Y not computationally feasible for me"~~, ~~"Z takes hours"~~, ~~"To know W, must visit archive"~~ $\rightsquigarrow$  
**Get as close to the bleeding edge as you can.**

# Style Problems

## Style Problems

>- Claiming causality without causal identification  
~~"The effect of X"~~, ~~"X increases Y"~~
>- Writing a mystery novel  
~~Holding out until page 4~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ Reader _always_ knows result
>- Using the passive voice  
~~"an analysis was conducted"~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ "we analyze"
>- Getting the details wrong  
~~"logistical regression"~~, ~~"the OLS model"~~  
~~"the democrats and republicans"~~
>- Referring to the person rather than paper  
~~"He argues"~~ $\rightsquigarrow$ "@barker02 argues"
